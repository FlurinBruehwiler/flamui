# Flamui
A C# immediate mode desktop GUI framework.

**This Project is in very early development, not usable in any way!**

Immediate mode isn't speacial, it's how every modern web framework works...., the the question is just when and how much you rerender. The simplest is to just rerender everything 60 times per second, for now flamui takes this approach.

The framework uses a custom SDF based OpenGl Renderer and GLFW to manage Windows, Input, Graphics Context, etc. via [Silk.Net](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) Bindings.
